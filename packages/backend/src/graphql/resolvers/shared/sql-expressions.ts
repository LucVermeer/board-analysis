/**
 * Aliased board_difficulty_grades table for consensus grade lookups.
 * Resolves the community-voted grade from boardClimbStats.displayDifficulty
 * without a correlated subquery.
 *
 * ## Required joins (in order)
 *
 * Queries that use any of the expressions below must include these joins:
 *
 * 1. `boardClimbStats` — joined on (climbUuid, boardType, angle)
 * 2. `boardDifficultyGrades` — joined on (tick.difficulty, boardType) — user's logged grade
 * 3. `consensusGradeTable` — joined via `consensusGradeJoinCondition` — consensus grade
 *
 * Example:
 * ```ts
 * db.select({ difficultyName: difficultyNameWithFallbackExpr })
 *   .from(boardseshTicks)
 *   .leftJoin(boardClimbStats, ...)
 *   .leftJoin(boardDifficultyGrades, ...)
 *   .leftJoin(consensusGradeTable, consensusGradeJoinCondition)
 * ```
 *
 * If a required join is missing the query will produce nulls (not an error)
 * because these are LEFT JOINs with nullable column references.

/**
 * SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the Boardsesh grade↔tick JOIN condition on the
 * `board_climb_grades` table, keyed on the tick's OWN angle + board type + the
 * alias-resolved canonical climb UUID. Mirrors the `board_climb_stats` join the
 * tick queries already do (`COALESCE(aliases.canonical_uuid, ticks.climb_uuid)`),
 * so a tick pointing at a deduped-away alias UUID still resolves its grade.
 *
 * The three tables are named by the CALLER, so both worlds share one join shape:
 *  - the Drizzle tick queries pass the real (unaliased) table names
 *    (`boardsesh_ticks`, `board_climb_grades`, `board_climb_aliases`) — Drizzle
 *    renders those tables unaliased, so bare table-name qualification resolves;
 *  - the raw-SQL session-feed queries pass their short aliases (`t`, `bcg`, `bca`).
 *
 * Emits identifiers only, no bound params (the three alias strings are internal
 * constants, never user input), so it composes safely into both a Drizzle
 * `.leftJoin(table, <this>)` and a raw `sql\`... ON ${<this>}\`` fragment.
 *
 * ## Required joins (prerequisite — enforced by the call signature)
 *
 * A query using this condition must already have joined:
 *  1. `board_climb_aliases` — on (alias_uuid = ticks.climb_uuid, same board_type)
 *     so the COALESCE below falls back to the tick's own climb UUID for
 *     non-aliased ticks. The caller must name it via `aliases`.
 *  2. `board_climb_grades` via this condition, as a LEFT JOIN — a climb with no
 *     grade row (MoonBoard, too few ascents) returns NULL grade fields, which is
 *     the safe-degradation path everywhere (the UI keeps the Aurora grade).
 *
 * Example (Drizzle):
 * ```ts
 * db.select({ boardseshDifficulty: boardseshDifficultyExpr, boardseshConfidence: boardseshConfidenceExpr })
 *   .from(boardseshTicks)
 *   .leftJoin(boardClimbAliases, ...)
 *   .leftJoin(dbSchema.boardClimbGrades, boardseshGradeTickJoin({
 *     ticks: 'boardsesh_ticks', grades: 'board_climb_grades', aliases: 'board_climb_aliases',
 *   }))
 * ```
 *
 * @param ticks   table name/alias for `boardsesh_ticks` ('boardsesh_ticks' or 't')
 * @param grades  table name/alias for `board_climb_grades` ('board_climb_grades' or 'bcg')
 * @param aliases table name/alias for `board_climb_aliases` ('board_climb_aliases' or 'bca')
