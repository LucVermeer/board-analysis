/**
 * Replaces the entire app with a dead-end update screen when it is running
 * inside the retired Capacitor app.
 *
 * That app was a WebView on boardsesh.com, so it keeps loading the live site
 * long after its source was deleted (PR #3175). PostHog puts the remaining
 * installs at a couple of people a day, all of whom are better served by the
 * React Native rewrite, so the old shell stops here: no dismiss, no snooze, no
 * flag. Swapping out `children` rather than painting over them means the live
 * app — BLE, the party-session socket, board presence — is torn down too,
 * instead of running invisibly behind a blocking screen.
 *
 * `window.Capacitor` exists only inside that WebView (the RN app never renders
 * the web UI and browsers never inject it), so this can't reach anyone else.
 * Nothing but that real bridge can trigger the takeover — no user-agent
 * heuristic, which would also match Instagram and Facebook in-app WKWebViews.
