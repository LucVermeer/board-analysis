// SET_CURRENT_CLIMB coalescer.
//
// Rapid swipes through the queue can fire setCurrentClimb mutations faster
// than the backend can process them. Stacking them up at the client is wasted
// work — only the latest target climb matters. This factory implements
// "serialize-and-supersede": at most one mutation in flight, the most recent
// pending args win.
//
// A dropped SET_CURRENT_CLIMB costs two things, not one. The pointer move
// self-heals (the next activation or any peer broadcast re-establishes it), but
// a `shouldAddToQueue:true` payload's brand-new queue slot does not — the
// reducer already inserted it locally and no later activation retroactively
// adds it, so the climb would sit in this climber's queue and nobody else's.
// So both ways a pending activation can lose its setCurrentClimb fire the
// content half on its own via `sendDeferredQueueAdd`:
//   1. superseded while pending (a newer activation replaced it), and
//   2. drained and then rejected (rate limit, socket blip) — #3936.
//
// Extracted from web's
// `packages/web/app/components/persistent-session/hooks/use-queue-mutations.ts`
// so mobile picks up the same semantics. Pure TS — no React, no GraphQL
// client coupling. Callers wire `sendArgs` / `sendDeferredQueueAdd` to
// their platform-specific transport.
