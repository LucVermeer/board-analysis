/**
 * Why one upstream logbook row could not be written.
 *
 * Machine-stable strings, not sentences: they are the grouping key for the
 * triage query in docs/aurora-sync.md, so re-wording one silently splits a
 * cluster in two. Add a value here rather than free-texting into `detail`.
 *
 * - invalid_angle      angle isn't a finite int4. Unwritable (`angle` is NOT
 *                      NULL) and there is no honest default — a tick at a
 *                      guessed angle is wrong data.
 * - invalid_identity   climb_uuid / aurora_id missing or carrying a byte
 *                      Postgres can't store (NUL, lone surrogate). The row
 *                      can't be keyed, so it can't be deduped or re-synced.
 * - normalize_failed   the row threw in normalizeAscent/normalizeBid — the
 *                      parse-time class PR #3872 (issue #3520) skips-and-logs.
 * - db_write_rejected  the row parsed and validated but Postgres still refused
 *                      it. The catch-all: whatever validation didn't predict.
 *
 * Enforced as a pgEnum rather than free `text`: these are the GROUPING KEY of
 * the triage query, so one caller inserting an off-contract string would split
 * a cluster in two and quietly under-report it — the same class of hiding this
 * whole table exists to prevent. Adding a value needs an `ALTER TYPE … ADD
 * VALUE` migration, which is the intended friction.

/**
 * Upstream logbook rows the Aurora sync could not write — the quarantine that
 * makes dropping a row an acceptable outcome instead of silent data loss.
 *
 * ## Why this table exists
 *
 * A single upstream row that Postgres refuses (non-finite `angle`, a NUL byte
 * in a comment, a duplicate `aurora_id`) used to abort the batched chunk write
 * in applyLogbookChunk, which aborted syncUserData's ONE cross-table
 * transaction, which rolled back ascents, bids, circuits AND the sync
 * checkpoint together. The next cycle re-fetched the same row and re-crashed:
 * the user's logbook stopped updating permanently, with nothing surfaced
 * (#3871 — the DB-execution-time sibling of the parse-time wedge #3520).
 *
 * The fix skips the offending row and lets the checkpoint advance. That trade
 * is only defensible because of THIS table: `payload` keeps the normalized row,
 * so a skipped send is quarantined and replayable, not gone. Without it the fix
 * would be silently discarding a climber's send.
 *
 * ## Why a table and not a counter
 *
 * Aurora's user sync is incremental — the watermark advances even on a cycle
 * that skipped everything — so a per-cycle counter reports the problem once and
 * then clears itself on the next cycle, when the delta is empty and nothing was
 * skipped because nothing arrived. That is exactly how #3523's equivalent bug
 * stayed hidden for years. This table is STATE: a row persists while the
 * condition persists, and the sync deletes it the moment that `aurora_id`
 * writes cleanly (see reconcileLogbookSyncSkips), so a query against it always
 * answers "what is broken right now", never "what ever broke".
 *
 * Triage query + reason codes: docs/aurora-sync.md.
