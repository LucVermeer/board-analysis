/**
 * Defer mounting heavy content until the next frame after `active` becomes true,
 * so a modal/present animation gets a cheap first frame and the heavy content
 * fills in one frame later — WITHOUT the InteractionManager starvation risk.
 *
 * Returns `false` until a single `requestAnimationFrame` fires after `active`
 * turns true, then `true`. Unlike `runAfterInteractions`, a rAF can't be starved
 * by a lingering interaction handle (a bottom-sheet present, a leaked handle), so
 * no fallback timer is needed — the frame always comes. Resets to `false` when
 * `active` goes false, so the next activation re-defers. Stays ready across
 * in-place content changes while `active` holds true (e.g. the play-drawer board
 * swiping between climbs once the drawer is open).
