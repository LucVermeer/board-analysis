/**
 * The journal-vs-ledger gaps production already carried when the deploy gate
 * started failing on them.
 *
 * `VERIFY_MIGRATION_JOURNAL=1` landed fail-closed (#2933) and immediately
 * blocked every production deploy: `migrate` is the `needs:` gate for both
 * `deploy-web` and `deploy-production-backend`, and the production ledger has no
 * row matching 20 of the 188 journal entries. None of those 20 are recent — they
 * accumulated over two years, so the gate's first run reported a backlog rather
 * than the regression it was built to catch.
 *
 * Every migration below is subtracted before the gate throws. A gap in any
 * *other* journal entry still fails the deploy, which is the case that matters:
 * the incident behind #2933 was a freshly appended migration
 * (`0129_numerous_star_brand`) that drizzle's high-water mark skipped, and that
 * shape is still caught on the first deploy after it happens. The gate keeps
 * naming the baselined tags on every run, so they stay visible instead of
 * becoming permanently invisible.
 *
 * ## Why each entry carries a hash
 *
 * Tolerating a *tag* would outlive the file it was recorded against. Edit one of
 * these `.sql` files and drizzle computes a new expected hash; the database still
 * has no matching row, and the migration's old `when` keeps it from replaying —
 * so a tag-only baseline would report "known gap, deploy on" while the edited DDL
 * never ran. That is the silent failure this gate exists to catch, re-created one
 * layer up.
 *
 * So each entry pins the hash the file had when the gap was recorded. Same tag,
 * different content, and the gap is fatal again with the change named. The hashes
 * come from drizzle's own `readMigrationFiles`, the same source the gate compares
 * against, and `migration-journal-verification.integration.test.ts` asserts they
 * still match the files on disk — so an edit to a baselined migration reddens the
 * PR rather than the deploy.
 *
 * ## What is in here
 *
 * A missing ledger row has two possible causes and this list mixes both, because
 * telling them apart needs the production schema in front of you (see
 * `docs/db-migrations.md`):
 *
 *  - **The `.sql` changed after production applied it.** The ledger stores the
 *    hash of the file as it was when it ran, so an edit orphans the row.
 *    `0103_thick_puck` is the clearest case: it landed as bare `CREATE TABLE`
 *    and was rewritten with `IF NOT EXISTS` guards a day later, after the deploy
 *    that applied the original. 11 of the 20 entries below have more than one
 *    content version in git history, which is the same signature.
 *  - **The migration never ran, or its row was lost.** The high-water-mark skip
 *    (#2933's own failure mode), or a hand repair / restore that rebuilt the
 *    schema without the ledger row. The `0025`–`0029` block arrived with the
 *    migration consolidation in #470, which rewrote the journal around rows that
 *    already existed.
 *
 * That second cause is why this file is a stopgap and not a resolution: if one
 * of these migrations genuinely never ran, its objects are absent in production
 * and this list is now hiding that. The entries are itemised rather than
 * collapsed into a "before tag N" cut-off precisely so shrinking the list is a
 * normal reviewable diff — repair one against production, delete its line.
 *
 * ## Shrinking it
 *
 * `DB_URL=postgres://... vp run db:verify-journal` prints each remaining tag
 * with the ledger hash its repair row needs. Repair per `docs/db-migrations.md`
 * ("The journal-vs-ledger check"), then remove the entry here. Do not add one
 * without a reason: a new gap means a migration that did not reach production,
 * and baselining it ships the outage #2933 was closed to prevent.
